      Technology, exploring different cultures, and continuously learning, have
      been at the forefront of my life. I love the thrill of producing creative
      and innovative solutions in a collaborative environment, while continuing
      to learn from others, and from my own experiences.

      In 2017 I founded SWFL Coders, a local community meetup and we are now
      more than 750 members. We meet bi-monthly to learn the latest trending
      technologies while sharing and helping each other. We believe in diversity
      and welcome anyone who is a developer or simply is interested in entering
      the fantastic world of programming.
