  <h4>Becoming a Developer</h4>
  <p>
    After learning graphic design and managing an e-commerce site, I got very curious about Web Development while wanting to learn something new.
    I found GA and has been the best decision I have ever made. This remote program was more interactive than I expected. A day in GA is challenging, but at the end of the day, so rewarding. To see how much we have learned is the best feeling I can embrace.
    There are too many things I like about GA, the sense of community, the teaching team is top notch and the outcomes team has been fully supportive. The support from my classmates also plays a big role in my positive experience, helping each other along the way.
    I learned so much, not only did I learned the hard skills but also personal skills like: time management, networking and the enthusiasm to keep learning something new.
